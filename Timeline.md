# Timeline

Ping! publishes one print issue per semester, and several articles online. While the online articles are edited and published as and one someone submits them, the print issue will not happen without active effort from the editors. The editor works along with the authors in bringing out articles, and working with the magazine is a great way for any budding writer to improve their skills. 

The following is a suggested timeline for editors to follow, and they are strongly advised to stick to it:

- One meeting in the first week of the semester. Discuss ideas, choose articles, get deadlines for each
- Every week at weekly meetings work on two-three article authors and finish articles
- Every week must have (both) chief editors, heads of marketing. Sponsorship and treasurer if need to discuss deals.
- Align deadlines and author meetings with weekly meetings. Also design articles as they finish.
- Finish all within 6-7 weeks. Before end of second month of college.
- Submit to printer on last day of second month of semester.

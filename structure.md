#  The meetings

+ Have a big meeting putting out all the topics. Motivate people to write.
+ Give everyone their articles and their deadlines.
+ Have weekly/ fortnightly Ping! boardroom meetings:
  + The editors and authors who have to meet the editors that week will be present at the meeting
  + In general, there should be a theme that people were informed beforehand, eg: some new college policy, important current news that affects students.
  + Anyone on campus can come to the boardroom meetings and discuss the issues. Those specifically involved in issues will be invited (members of parliament, members         of a committee, etc)
  + Anyone on campus who wants to talk about any issue/ article idea can come to any boardroom meeting to discuss them.
  + Ideally every boardroom meeting ends with the editor/ authors writing a report on the issue discussed, and opinions if any, that were generated during the meeting.
  + Even if there are no opinions worth writing about, the issue will be reported as is.

# Kinds of articles
+ Magazine articles - being written for the magazine, and helped by the editors
+ Boardroom articles - generated after every boardroom meeting.
+ Articles that come by throughout the semester - just published then

# Finishing an article
+ Enforce: everyone gets a two week period when they're supposed to write their article
+ Meet with the editors at least twice
+ Dedicated illustrator working with you
+ In case you can't make it the two weeks you got, you need to exchange with someone else. 
+ Attend the boardroom meetings in your week

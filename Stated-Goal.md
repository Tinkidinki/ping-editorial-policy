Ping! is a young newsletter of a young institute. With being young, comes love, passion and a yearning for etching oneâ€™s name in the history books.

With Ping!, we strive to give the community a voice. Not just a voice that is heard, but a voice that is listened to, understood and given its due consideration. Ping! wants to be the platform that says what everyone thinks, but no one says out loud.

Ping! aims to reiterate to the campus community that awareness is king. There is power in numbers and awareness is the way to get those numbers. Awareness is the first big step to bringing change, and Ping! wants to be part of that big step that people take.

Ping! wants to target apathy. And it wants people to have fun while doing it.

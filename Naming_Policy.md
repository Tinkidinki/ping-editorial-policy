# Naming Policy

## Introduction 

Ping! would like to be a platform for effective journalism and raising issues while not calling out people unethically.

The editor is required to follow the following guidelines while making a decision whether to allow a name in an article or not.

The key idea at any point is whether the public interest in naming the person justifies the violation of the person's privacy. The conflict between these two is discussed in many contexts as shown below.

This means that in general, in any **non-positive context**, persons should not be named unless deemed absolutely necessary by the author and editor(s). (Definition of "positive/non-positive contexts are given below")

If any instance of naming satisfies a [Trial](http://www.supremecourtcases.com/index2.php?option=com_content&itemid=1&do_pdf=1&id=22062) [by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_media) [Media](https://www.livelaw.in/trial-by-media/) situation, do not name.

The editor must also respect the college policy on non-naming, a person may not be named during a DISCO trial, or an ARC trial. (Find out more)

## Naming can be divided in three ways based on the context and connotation.
+ Positive, Negative, Neutral
+ Satirical or Serious
+ Regular person, or person holding a postion of responsibility

## Positive, Neutral, and Negative

### Positive
**Definition:** A naming in positive context is when the article is holding said person in positive light (by natural law, for lack of better explanation). These include winning something, having done good work, etc. 

In such cases, the editor may assume permission to name the person. In case after publication the named person(only the named person) requests redaction for some reason, their name will be redacted with a note.

### Negative or Neutral (Non-Positive)
**Definition:** A naming in negative context is when the article is holding said person in negative light (by natural law, for lack of better explanation). These include allegations of representatives not doing their duties, ragging. 

A naming in neutral context is any that doesn't obviously fall under one of the two previous categories.

In general, avoid naming, or referencing in any manner which will lead to the article showing up in a direct search of the name. Instances of reasonable naming here would be to refer to someone as "such and such elected member of some body"; to people in college to whom this is of relevance this is informative, but not to anyone beyond.

(To think: College interest vs world interest)

## Satire and Serious Articles

### Satire
(Zubair's suggestion): Don't name anyone. Refer to people by position, or nicknames/initials/inside jokes/fake names.

(To think)

### Serious Article
+ The author must provide the editor with reasonable evidence to believe the content of the article. The editor may require the author to file a complaint to an official body in case of a serious accusation. 
+ The editor is required to contact the accused (if not already contacted by the author) for a statement *before* the publication of the article, and publish whatever the accused says verbatim. 
+ Author cannot be anonymous (discuss)

## Person in position of responsibility vs Others

### Person holding a position of responsibility
Negligence and non performance of duty while holding a position of responsibility in college counts as public interest, and the person maybe named for this. For any misconduct not related to the said person's position of responsibility, please follow whatever is done for normal people.

(Zubair): Try to avoid naming directly, like mentioned earlier for non-positive contexts. If the editors and authors find it absolutely necessary to name, there should be follow up articles if the situation they were named for changes, with cross-referencing links across all articles. Also, the person being named should be informed beforehand for response. Refer to the conditions of Serious Articles above.

Justification: Responsibility is important, but is only relevant in the context of the college at a particular moment in time. 

### Normal person
Anything that is a crime according to the Indian Penal Code that *also* harms other people is considered to be of public interest and a person maybe named for commiting such crime.

(Zubair:) To consider

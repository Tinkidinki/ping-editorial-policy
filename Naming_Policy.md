# Introduction
Ping! would like to be a platform for journalism that raises awareness and brings out change while
ensuring that journalistic ethics are followed. One small but important aspect of this is naming individuals.
In general, naming people is a violation of their privacy, and people must only be named if the public 
interest in naming the person justifies the violation of the person's privacy.
## Principles (To name or not to name)
### Positive contexts
This is quite straightforward and anyone may be named in a positive context (These include winning something, having done good work, etc.) Permission to name the person can be assumed if this is already public, and must be sought if not.

### Non-positive contexts

#### Serious Articles
##### Persons holding positions of responsibility
Negligence and non-performance of duty while holding a position of responsibility counts as public interest and people may be named for this. Truth here can be established by checking the research done and facts presented by the author, as well as any email threads.

##### Acts that cause harm to others in society
+ A person may be named for this __only__ if by naming, the article has the potential to reduce said harm significantly (and is therefore of public interest). If not, the article will be published without the names. 
+ If the sole reason for naming is retribution, or for the victim to gain justice, the person should not be named. Ping! is not a justice-providing body, but one that spreads awareness to the extent necessary.
+ The editor must carefully consider the status quo, look for corrobarative evidence and talk with relevent people while considering the truth and the public interest of the article. 

#### Satirical Articles
Sections like Cynical Cindy, and Wise Wendy and other satirical pieces tend to mock and exaggerate situations, and hence no one should be named in any indexable way. People may be referred to by position/ nicknames/ initials/ fake names.

## Implementation (How to name)
Once it has been established by the above that whatever has been stated about said 
person is __true__  and naming a person in a non-positive context is of __public interest__, the following must be strictly followed:

+ The author cannot be anonymous (to check)

+ In case of accusations, the editor must ensure that the author has already contacted the
the relevent committee in campus responsible for handling the situation and has received a 
negative response, or the author has not received a response even after waiting a sufficient 
amount of time. (how long?)

+ The entire article must be sent to those named before publication for their comments
and their statements must be included with the article verbatim. All possible means will 
be used to reach them and the article will be published without their statement only if 
none was given after waiting three-four days for a response.

+ After the article has been published, if there are significant improvements to the status quo as mentioned 
in the article (especially one that makes any section of the article or any accusation false), those must be edited into the article as and when they occur. The editor/ author/ staff writers may contact the relevent bodies to find out about the same. It might be useful to keep a note of articles with accusations, to follow up on the same.

## Redaction (When and how to remove names)
+ In case any of the mentioned details about a person happened to be false, the names will be redacted. 
+ In case it is realised after publication that the naming policy has not been followed in principle, the names will be redacted with an apology.
+ In case it is realised after publication that the naming policy has not been followed implementation-wise, the names will be redacted with a note explaining this. The editor will wait for sufficient time/ send the article to relevant people for comments, and the article will be re-published with the changes.
+ In case anyone named in positive context requests for redaction of name, names will be redacted with a note.
+ In case anyone named in a non-positive context requests for redaction of the names, even though the naming policy has been followed both principally and implementation-wise, the names will not be redacted. Note that it is important to follow the fourth clause of implementation strictly to ensure this non-redaction is ethical.

# Naming Policy

## Introduction 

Ping! would like to be a platform for effective journalism and raising issues while not calling out people unethically.

The editor is required to follow the following guidelines while making a decision whether to allow a name in an article or not.

The key idea at any point is whether the public interest in naming the person justifies the violation of the person's privacy. The conflict between these two is discussed in many contexts as shown below.

The editor must also respec 

### Naming can be divided in three ways based on the context and connotation.
+ Positive, Negative, Neutral
+ Satirical or Serious
+ Regular person, or person holding a postion of responsibility

## Positive
In all cases where the naming of the person is in a positive context, the editor may assume permission to name the person. These include winning something, having done good work, etc. In case after publication the named person(only the named person) requests redaction for some reason, his/ her name will be redacted with a note.

## Negative
(To think: College interest vs world interest)
### Satire
(To think)
### Serious Article
#### Person holding a position of responsibility
Negligence and non performance of duty while holding a position of responsibility in college counts as public interest, and the person maybe named for this. For any misconduct not related to the said person's position of responsibility, please follow whatever is done for normal people.
#### Normal person
Anything that is a crime according to the Indian Penal Code that *also* harms other people is considered to be of public interest and a person maybe named for commiting such crime.

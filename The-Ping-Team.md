## The Ping! Team

In the beginning of every year, the current editors will hold a meeting to introduce everyone to Ping! Those who wish to will be kept in the loop. 
After about a month, those who show demonstrated interest (writing a first draft, drawing a picture, designing, helping with marketing, etc) will form the core Ping! team.

# Guiding Principles of the Editorial Policy

## Correctness
Any information in Ping! will be accurate. Neither the format nor the speed by which one wants to publish is an excuse to forgo correctness of 
any information that is present in an article. For example, an editorial in the April 2018 issue was titled '[professor] gets the sack' while 
while the professor had not been sacked, but had left on his own accord. The title was changed to '[professor] leaves' although the first title
sounded more appealing, and the correction caused delay in publication.

## Fairness
To adhere to the first principal, in cases where the source of information is people's memory, parties with opposing views will be consulted before publication. 
Reportage will be as unbiased as possible. In the article 'Ragging or the Acceptable Sexual Harassment', the accused were not asked for a statement before the article, but were asked for one immediately after.

## Quality
In case of perspectives or opinions, quality and coherence of arguments is the most important criteria for publication. Only in the rarest cases will the editor not publish an article because of value judgement. (re-check)
If the editor feels little can 
be done to improve quality of content, the article will not be published. However, if the quality of language or eloquence is the issue, the editor must try to work with the author to improve the article to the best of their ability.

## Value for Privacy
Ping! will not publish anything about anyone that does not concern the public. Due consent will be taken for photographs where it is not implicitly implied (see permissions policy). All authors are allowed to be anonymous except in the case of accusations in their article, where it is necessary to take responsibility (see naming policy).

## Diversity
Ping! will be a platform for having your voice heard, irrespective of who you are. While Ping! itself is an open platform, not all people express their opinons as often or as easily as others, and the editors must put in effort to bring out opinions and pieces from people who are generally not heard because of language, societal or other barriers.

## Changes to the Editorial Policy
(to think) Editors have final say, but ex-editors should be consulted (and members of the Ping! team, for changes that affect them)

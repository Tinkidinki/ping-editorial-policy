Eye To The Future

The column shall feature one article or opinion piece dealing in themes of technology and its impact on society, economy and culture; for every issue. The treatment may not be complete or unbiased, as long as it provokes an interesting line of enquiry, speculative or critical. The writing, however, must be sensitive to the audience it aims to target within the campus and the readership of the journal; while it would be expected that eventually the community and conversation around this column gets progressively more mature.
The Feature Column Editor assigned for this shall invite ideas from the general readership, and may choose, with an understanding of the EdBoard, any such theme for the column, independent of any other editorial feature of the journal. However, preference might be given to pieces, that

or, initiate discussion from some unfamiliar, but rigorous, perspective.
The Author(s), therefore shall be solely responsible for the opinions expressed. And with the exception of Editor's responsibility for the manner of expression, the magazine shall not be responsible for the same. Vulgarity and profanity shall be heavily discouraged, and plagiarism shall be responded with blacklisting.
The Author(s), may choose to republish or make available for syndication such piece published in this column, if they so choose to, once the web edition has been published, only if the reprint carries the link to original publication on Ping website.

# Guiding Principles of the Editorial Policy

## Correctness
+ Any information in Ping! will be accurate. Neither the format nor the speed by which one wants to publish is an excuse to forgo correctness of 
any information that is present in an article. For example, an editorial in the April 2018 issue was titled '<professor> gets the sack' while 
while the professor had not been sacked, but had left on his own accord. The title was changed to '<professor> leaves' although the first title
sounded more appealing, and the correction caused delay in publication.

## Quality
+ In case of perspectives or opinions, quality and coherence of arguments is the most important criteria for publication. Only in the rarest cases will 
the editor If the editor feels little can 
be done to improve quality of content, the article will not be published. However, if the quality of language or eloquence is the issue, the editor must try to work with the author to improve the article to the best of their ability.

## Zubair's Notes

#### General notes I'm considering while framing the policy

1. Do not get sued. We can't manage that, do not have any backing to get us through something serious
2. If following aspects of major media houses (Questioning responsibilities of representatives, Raising issues, etc) follow up on them similarly - cover all bases of responsible journalism. [Follow the ethics code](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp)
3. Avoid any instance of Trial by Media at all costs.
4. Remember at all times, Ping is as accountable as any other body, especially so if questioning others.
